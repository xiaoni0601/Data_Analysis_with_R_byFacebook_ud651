# Quiz2 Price Histogram
```{r}
# Create a histogram of the price of
# all the diamonds in the diamond data set.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE
# =======================================
ggplot(aes(x=price),data=diamonds)+geom_histogram()
```
#Quiz3 Price Histogram Summary
```{r}
# The distribution is tailed. 
summary(diamonds$price)
```
#Quiz4 Diamond Counts
```{r }

```

#Quiz5 Cheaper Diamonds
```{r }
# Explore the largest peak in the
# price histogram you created earlier.

# Try limiting the x-axis, altering the bin width,
# and setting different breaks on the x-axis.

# There won’t be a solution video for this
# question so go to the discussions to
# share your thoughts and discover
# what other people find.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Submit your final code when you are ready.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE
# ======================================================================
qplot(x=price,data=diamonds,binwidth=30) +
         scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,20000))

#Quiz6 Price by Cut Histograms
```{r}
# Break out the histogram of diamond prices by cut.

# You should have five histograms in separate
# panels on your resulting plot.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE
# ======================================================
names(diamonds)
ggplot(aes(x=price),data=diamonds)+geom_histogram()+
                  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(10,20000))+
                  facet_wrap(~cut)

```
Do you think the distributions look the same or different?
response: No

# Quiz7: Price by Cut
Which cut has the highest price diamond?

Which cut has the lowest priced diamond?

Which cut has the lowest median price?

```{r}
by(diamonds$price,diamonds$cut,summary)
```

 Which cut has the highest price diamond?
response:Premium,Max is 18823

Which cut has the lowest priced diamond?
response:Premium and Ideal,Min is 326

Which cut has the lowest median price?
response:Ideal, Median is 1810

# Quiz8:Scales and Multiple Histograms
```{r}
# Look up the documentation for facet_wrap in R Studio.
# Then, scroll back up and add a parameter to facet_wrap so that
# the y-axis in the histograms is not fixed. You want the y-axis to
# be different for each histogram.

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) + facet_grid(cut ~ color)

```
#Quiz9:Price per Carat by Cut
```{r}
# Create a histogram of price per carat
# and facet it by cut. You can make adjustments
# to the code from the previous exercise to get
# started.

# Adjust the bin width and transform the scale
# of the x-axis using log10.

#Hint 1: You use the price and carat variables in the parameter for x. # What expression gives you price per carat?

#Hint 2: For long tailed distributions, you can add a ggplot layer such #as scale_x_log10() to transform the variable.

qplot(x=log10(price/carat),data=diamonds) +
  facet_wrap(~cut)

```

# Quiz10:Price Box Plots}
```{r}
# Investigate the price of diamonds using box plots,
# numerical summaries, and one of the following categorical
# variables: cut, clarity, or color.

# There won’t be a solution video for this
# exercise so go to the discussion thread for either
# BOXPLOTS BY CLARITY, BOXPLOT BY COLOR, or BOXPLOTS BY CUT
# to share you thoughts and to
# see what other people found.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for

#Quiz13: Carat Frequenct Polygon
Investigate the weight of the diamonds(carat)using a frequency polygon.Use different bin difths to see how the frequency polygon changes. what carat size has a count greater than 2000?
-- 0.3 and 1.01.

```{r}
#ggplot(diamonds,aes(carat))+geom_freqpoly(binwidth=0.1)

# Quiz15:Gapminder Data

```{r}
# The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about
# the world's population. Your task is to download a data set of your choice
# and create 2-5 plots that make use of the techniques from Lesson 3.

# You might use a simple histogram, a boxplot split over a categorical variable,
# or a frequency polygon. The choice is yours!

# You can find a link to the Gapminder website in the Instructor Notes.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
#       1. any questions you answered, your observations, and summary statistics
#       2. snippets of code that created the plots
#       3. links to the images of your plots

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.

# Quiz16.Exploring Your Friends' Birthdays
```{r}
# Your task is to investigate the distribution of your friends'
# birth months and days.

# Here some questions you could answer, and we hope you think of others.

# **********************************************************************

#Q: How many people have the same birthday as you?
# A:0
# Which month contains the most number of birthdays?
# A:March
# How many birthdays are in each month?
# A:1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 
#   89 79 98 81 72 93 86 91 96 89 87 72 
# Which day of the year has the most number of birthdays?
# A:14
# Do you have at least 365 friends that have birthdays on everyday
# of the year?
#A:yes.
# **********************************************************************

# You will need to do some data munging and additional research to
# complete this task. This task won't be easy, and you may encounter some
# unexpected challenges along the way. We hope you learn a lot from it though.

# You can expect to spend 30 min or more on this task depending if you
# use the provided data or obtain your personal data. We also encourage you
# to use the lubridate package for working with dates. Read over the documentation
# in RStudio and search for examples online if you need help.

# You'll need to export your Facebooks friends' birthdays to a csv file.
# You may need to create a calendar of your Facebook friends’ birthdays
# in a program like Outlook or Gmail and then export the calendar as a
# csv file.

# Once you load the data into R Studio, you can use the strptime() function
# to extract the birth months and birth days. We recommend looking up the
# documentation for the function and finding examples online.

# We've included some links in the Instructor Notes to help get you started.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions
# that includes:
#   1. any questions you answered, your observations, and summary statistics
#   2. snippets of code that created the plots
#   3. links to the images of your plots

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
